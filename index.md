### A game of combined Dama and Chess with a twist made with Python 3
[**Download it here**](https://github.com/marckoxx/Dama-Chess/releases/download/0.1-alpha/Dama-Chess.Alpha.v0.1.zip) 

This is my first project and also the first beta release of the game.

So keep in mind the following before you start playing:




**What you can do:**

- Chess moves (including en passant but not castling)
- Dama moves, but only forward (will add backward takes later)
- Clicking the piece and then clicking the end square (will add dragging later)
- Undo moves (default key is 'z')
- Reset game (default key is 'r')
- Quit game (default key is 'Esc')

**What you can't do:**

- Doing double/triple/etc and backwards dama takes. Yes isa isa lang hinay hinay lang muna (Sorry I'll add that in the next release)
- Play with a friend (will suggest an alternative down below)
- Play with a bot/AI (will add that later)
- Get a life
- Succeed



**Instructions:**

- Standard chess and dama rules apply(?) (you know, checkmate/stalemate or yeet all the enemy pieces into the void)
> (You can only be checked/checkmated if the enemy is using a chess move. I'm sorry I'll fix that later. But you know, cut me some slack. That's why it's a beta release.)
- You start with a dama board and the game will be normal(except you're both Kingless)
- But, it gets tricky when you or your enemy makes the first promotion.



- For the first(1st) promotion, the promoted pawn will become a queen, and the player can choose any enemy pawn and then turn it into the enemy's king.
- To select what enemy pawn you want to convert to their king, please input in the terminal the pawn row, then column.
- The enemy pawn locations will be shown in the terminal after you make the move.


Please note that:

| File:         | Rank:         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A = col 0     | 1 = row 7     |
| B = col 1     | 2 = row 6     |
| C = col 2     | 3 = row 5     |
| D = col 3     | 4 = row 4     |
| E = col 4     | 5 = row 3     |
| F = col 5     | 6 = row 2     |
| G = col 6     | 7 = row 1     |
| H = col 7     | 8 = row 0     |

respectively.

As you can probably guess, the first one to get a promotion will be on a huge advantage, so goodluck on that.



**But, it doesn't end there.**



- For the second(2nd) promotion, you can choose any piece except a Bishop and a Pawn(BRUH)[K, Q, R, N].
> (Please use the terminal to type the letter in UPPERCASE or in ALL CAPITALS. You'll be murdered by 12 midnight if you don't)
> Initially it was a promotion, and a respawn of any piece at the same time(so 1 one strong piece + 1 any piece, a win-win)
> But I'll figure out how to code that later. For now please be satisfied with a normal promotion.


- For the third(3rd) promotion, your pawn will become a bishop.
> Only the bishop has the real "dama" moves (You know, flying in the board while hopping over enemy pieces)
> (But for now it's just standard bishop moves, 'cause my little poopoo brain still can't figure out a way to implement it. Sumimasen.)


- For the fourth(4th), same as second(2nd), for the fifth(5th), same as third(3rd), and so on and so forth to infinity and beyod.



As you can see the game is pretty bare bones and stupid as of now, so to play with a friend, I suggest doing the following:
1. One of you download the game(duh)
2. The one who downloaded the game does a screenshare (I recommend using discord for this. Or idk maybe stream in twitch and let the chat be your opponent lmao)
2.5. Or you can grant/allow remote access to your PC(NOT RECOMMENDED)
3. Then other player will just Magnus Carlsen the hell out of the game. 
> If you don't know what's that, basically the player just announces "[piece] to [file,rank]" or "[file,rank] to [file,rank]" e.g. knight to e6 or a2 to a4
> (idk if it's a joke but I think it's just funny how magnus defeated 3(5?) players while blindfolded using the method above.)



So yeah, please give feedbacks (bugs, features you want to be added in the future, comments, etc)

When reporting a bug, please state what happened **AND** how did you arrive to that situation. (Makes debugging a lot easier, thanks.)
